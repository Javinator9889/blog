Maybe you are aÂ _GoDaddy_ user, maybe you have heard about it. Nowadays,Â *GoDaddy* has become in one of theÂ **most important companies** which helps webmasters and developersÂ _organize_ andÂ _host_ their websites easily and economically.

But what you have maybe noticed is that there is noÂ **DDNS** for updating the &#8216;_A&#8217; Record_ IP. If you do not knowÂ **what an &#8216;A&#8217; record** is, basically it works like a routing way for finding the IP associated with a server. For example, suppose that you have bought the domain:Â _example.com_ but your server is running behind aÂ **dynamic public IP** so after some time it changes. If you want people to access your website through that domain, you will have to make that domain point to yourÂ _actually public IP_, having this value updated whenever it changes.

As you may have notices, this is a &#8220;hard&#8221; work as you must be looking for any change on your public IP for updating the DNS &#8216;A&#8217; records. Here it comesÂ [pyGoDaddyUpdater][1].

[pyGoDaddyUpdater][1] is aÂ **Python application** that will allow you to setup a customÂ _GoDaddy_ DDNS service, running in the background. It has several possibilities:

  * Specify the domain to be updated.
  * Specify which &#8216;A&#8217; record (by name) will be changed.
  * The time interval between checks.
  * Run the daemon as a specific user (and group).
  * Setup more than one domains and names.

What is the main difference between other options? Basically, its main capability is thatÂ **can be executed as a daemon** by itself, without your interaction. That is, after you have successfully register your data, the script will start running in the background until it is interrupted. In this way, it can be easily stopped and, in addition, you can create a newÂ **boot service** so it will start when your server wakes up.

In order to start using it, you have to:

  1. Go to <https://developer.godaddy.com/getstarted> and generate a newÂ _key pair_ that you will use as aÂ **developer account**. TheÂ _key_ andÂ _secret_ you will need are available [at this link][3]. The environment you will need to create and use is theÂ **Production** one.
  2. Keep safe bothÂ _key_ andÂ _secret_ as we will use them in the next execution.
  3. InstallÂ **Python 3** andÂ **pip** on your system, as we will use them for running the service.
  4. Install [pyGoDaddyUpdater][1] usingÂ _setup.py_ orÂ _pip:  
_ </p> <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">sudo pip3 install pyGoDaddyUpdater</pre>
    
    ForÂ _setup.py_ instructions, please refer to the [official GitHub repository.][4]</li> 
    
      * Get prepared for the first execution. You will need:Â _domain name_, _&#8216;A&#8217; record name_,Â _developer keyÂ _andÂ _secret key_. Then, run the program as follows: <pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate" title="">[sudo] godaddy_ddns --domain example.com --name @ --key YOUR_KEY --secret YOUR_SECRET</pre>
        
        TheÂ _sudo_ value is in brackets because it depends on your configuration, as you may need or not it. In addition, there are several options you can define for a better experience, as the **update interval time** or the **userÂ **(andÂ **group**) that will be executing the command. Please refer to the [official GitHub repository][5] for more information.</li> 
        
          * After running the program, you can check theÂ _logs_ and theÂ _pid_ at the following locations, if you did not change it: 
            <pre>/var/log/pygodaddy.log</pre>
            
            <pre>/var/run/pygodaddy.pid</pre>
        
          * The next time you run the script, you will needÂ **no arguments** as the program storesÂ _your preferences_ for you.</ol> 
        
        **And that&#8217;s it!** Now you have set up aÂ _Dynamic DNS_ service that will be running in background until you restart your computer. You can also define anÂ **init.dÂ **script that will be run on boot. You can have a look at an [automatic tool I developed][6] which will allow you toÂ _create on boot scriptsÂ _interactively. In addition, here you have the [project link][1] in which you can find more information about howÂ **pyGoDaddy** works andÂ _extra useful options_.
