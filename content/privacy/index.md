## About us  


The address of our website is: https://javinator9889.sytes.net/blog. 

## What personal information we collect and why we collect it  


### Comments 

When visitors leave comments on the web, we collect the data that is displayed in the comments form, as well as the visitor&#8217;s IP address and the browser&#8217;s user agent chain to help detect spam.

An anonymous chain created from your email address (also called a hash) can be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The privacy policy of the Gravatar service is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After the approval of your comment, the image of your profile is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

### Media

If you upload images to the web you should avoid uploading images with location data (GPS EXIF) included. Visitors to the web can download and extract any location data from the web images.
